# Fully-Analogue-Line-Follower-EN2091-
This repository contains the complete design and documentation for a fully analogue line-following robot developed for the EN2091 module. The system uses discrete electronic components—operational amplifiers, IR sensors, waveform generators, comparators, and a PID-based control stage to achieve real-time line tracking without any microcontrollers.
